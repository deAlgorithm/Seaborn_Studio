# Seaborn_Studio
This repository showcases various data visualization techniques using **Python Seaborn**. The primary libraries used in this project are **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. The goal is to explore how to visualize different types of data effectively and to understand the insights these visualizations can provide.

## Project Goals
- Learn how to create a variety of plots and charts using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- Understand the relationship between data and its visualization.
- Explore different types of visualizations for specific use cases, such as scatter plots, line charts, histograms, and heatmaps.
- Customize plots with colors, themes, and other visual elements for better storytelling.

## Libraries Used
- **Seaborn**: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib**: A foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for working with structured data (like CSV files or SQL databases).

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas
